                               THE SCARLET LETTER

                             by Nathaniel Hawthorne
INTRODUCTORY

                        THE CUSTOM-HOUSE.

               INTRODUCTORY TO "THE SCARLET LETTER".

  IT is a little remarkable, that- though disinclined to talk overmuch
of myself and my affairs at the fireside, and to my personal
friends- an autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have
taken possession of me, in addressing the public. The first time was
three or four years since, when I favoured the reader- inexcusably,
and for no earthly reason, that either the indulgent reader or the
intrusive author could imagine- with a description of my way of life
in the deep quietude of an Old Manse. And now- because, beyond my
deserts, I was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former
occasion- I again seize the public by the button, and talk of my three
years' experience in a Custom-House. The example of the famous "P. P.,
Clerk of this Parish," was never more faithfully followed. The truth
seems to be, however, that, when he casts his leaves forth upon the
wind, the author addresses, not the many who will fling aside his
volume, or never take it up, but the few who will understand him,
better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates. Some authors,
indeed, do far more than this, and indulge themselves in such
confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed,
only and exclusively, to the one heart and mind, of perfect
sympathy; as if the printed book, thrown at large on the wide world,
were certain to find out the divided segment of the writer's own
nature, and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into
communion with it. It is scarcely decorous, however, to speak all,
even where we speak impersonally. But, as thoughts are frozen and
utterance benumbed, unless the speaker stand in some true relation
with his audience, it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend, a
kind and apprehensive, though not the closest friend, is listening
to our talk; and then, a native reserve being thawed by this genial
consciousness, we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us,
and even of ourself, but still keep the inmost Me behind its veil.
To this extent, and within these limits, an author, methinks, may be
autobiographical, without violating either the reader's rights or
his own.

  It will be seen, likewise, that this Custom-House sketch has a
certain propriety, of a kind always recognised in literature, as
explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my
possession, and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a
narrative therein contained. This, in fact- a desire to put myself
in my true position as editor, or very little more, of the most prolix
among the tales that make up my volume- this, and no other, is my true
reason for assuming a personal relation with the public. In
accomplishing the main purpose, it has appeared allowable, by a few
extra touches, to give a faint representation of a mode of life not
heretofore described, together with some of the characters that move
in it, among whom the author happened to make one.

  In my native town of Salem, at the head of what, half a century ago,
in the days of old King Derby, was a bustling wharf- but which is
now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses, and exhibits few or no
symptoms of commercial life; except, perhaps, a bark or brig, half-way
down its melancholy length, discharging hides; or, nearer at hand, a
Nova Scotia schooner, pitching out her cargo of firewood- at the
head, I say, of this dilapidated wharf, which the tide often
overflows, and along which, at the base and in the rear of the row
of buildings, the track of many languid years is seen in a border of
unthrifty grass- here, with a view from its front windows adown this
not very enlivening prospect, and thence across the harbour, stands
a spacious edifice of brick. From the loftiest point of its roof,
during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon, floats or
droops, in breeze or calm, the banner of the republic; but with the
thirteen stripes turned vertically, instead of horizontally, and
thus indicating that a civil, and not a military post of Uncle Sam's
government is here established. Its front is ornamented with a portico
of half-a-dozen wooden pillars, supporting a balcony, beneath which
a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street. Over the
entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the American eagle, with
outspread wings, a shield before her breast, and, if I recollect
aright, a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each
claw. With the customary infirmity of temper that characterises this
unhappy fowl, she appears, by the fierceness of her beak and eye,
and the general truculency of her attitude, to threaten mischief to
the inoffensive community; and especially to warn all citizens,
careful of their safety, against intruding on the premises which she
overshadows with her wings. Nevertheless, vixenly as she looks, many
people are seeking, at this very moment, to shelter themselves under
the wing of the federal eagle; imagining, I presume, that her bosom
has all the softness and snugness of an eider-down pillow. But she has
no great tenderness, even in her best of moods, and, sooner or
later- oftener soon than late- is apt to fling off her nestlings, with
a scratch of her claw, a dab of her beak, or a rankling wound from her
barbed arrows.

  The pavement round about the above-described edifice- which we may
as well name at once as the Custom-House of the port- has grass enough
growing in its chinks to show that it has not, of late days, been worn
by any multitudinous resort of business. In some months of the year,
however, there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward
with a livelier tread. Such occasions might remind the elderly citizen
of that period before the last war with England, when Salem was a port
by itself; not scorned, as she is now, by her own merchants and
ship-owners, who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin, while their
ventures go to swell, needlessly and imperceptibly, the mighty flood
of commerce at New York or Boston. On some such morning, when three or
four vessels happen to have arrived at once- usually from Africa or
South America- or to be on the verge of their departure thitherward,
there is a sound of frequent feet, passing briskly up and down the
granite steps. Here, before his own wife has greeted him, you may
greet the sea-flushed shipmaster, just in port, with his vessel's
papers under his arm, in a tarnished tin box. Here, too, comes his
owner, cheerful or sombre, gracious or in the sulks, accordingly as
his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realised in
merchandise that will readily be turned to gold, or has buried him
under a bulk of incommodities, such as nobody will care to rid him of.
Here, likewise- the germ of the wrinkle-browed, grizzly-bearded,
care-worn merchant- we have the smart young clerk, who gets the
taste of traffic as a wolf-cub does of blood, and already sends
adventures in his master's ships, when he had better be sailing
mimic-boats upon a mill-pond. Another figure in the scene is the
outward-bound sailor, in quest of a protection; or the recently
arrived one, pale and feeble, seeking a passport to the hospital.
Nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that
bring firewood from the British provinces; a rough-looking set of
tarpaulins, without the alertness of the Yankee aspect, but
contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade.

  Cluster all these individuals together, as they sometimes were, with
other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group, and, for the time
being, it made the Custom-House a stirring scene. More frequently,
however, on ascending the steps, you would discern- in the entry, if
it were summer time, or in their appropriate rooms, if wintry or
inclement weather- a row of venerable figures, sitting in
old-fashioned chairs, which were tipped on their hind legs back
against the wall. Oftentimes they were asleep, but occasionally
might be heard talking together, in voices between speech and a snore,
and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of
alms-houses, and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on
charity, on monopolised labour, or anything else but their own
independent exertions. These old gentlemen- seated, like Matthew, at
the receipt of customs, but not very liable to be summoned thence,
like him, for apostolic errands- were Custom-House officers.

  Furthermore, on the left hand as you enter the front door, is a
certain room or office, about fifteen feet square, and of a lofty
height; with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the
aforesaid dilapidated wharf, and the third looking across a narrow
lane, and along a portion of Derby Street. All three give glimpses
of the shops of grocers, block-makers, slop-sellers, and
ship-chandlers; around the doors of which are generally to be seen,
laughing and gossiping, clusters of old salts, and such other
wharf-rats as haunt the Wapping of a seaport. The room itself is
cobwebbed, and dingy with old paint; its floor is strewn with grey
sand, in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse; and
it is easy to conclude, from the general slovenliness of the place,
that this is a sanctuary into which womankind, with her tools of
magic, the broom and mop, has very infrequent access. In the way of
furniture, there is a stove with a voluminous funnel; an old pine
desk, with a three-legged stool beside it; two or three
wooden-bottom chairs, exceedingly decrepit and infirm; and- not to
forget the library- on some shelves, a score or two of volumes of
the Acts of Congress, and a bulky Digest of the Revenue Laws. A tin
pipe ascends through the ceiling, and forms a medium of vocal
communication with other parts of the edifice. And here, some six
months ago- pacing from corner to corner, or lounging on the
long-legged stool, with his elbow on the desk, and his eyes
wandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaper- you
might have recognised, honoured reader, the same individual who
welcomed you into his cheery little study, where the sunshine
glimmered so pleasantly through the willow branches, on the western
side of the Old Manse. But now, should you go thither to seek him, you
would inquire in vain for the Locofoco Surveyor. The besom of reform
has swept him out of office; and a worthier successor wears his
dignity, and pockets his emoluments.

  This old town of Salem- my native place, though I have dwelt much
away from it, both in boyhood and maturer years- possesses, or did
possess, a hold on my affections, the force of which I have never
realised during my seasons of actual residence here. Indeed, so far as
its physical aspect is concerned, with its flat, unvaried surface,
covered chiefly with wooden houses, few or none of which pretend to
architectural beauty- its irregularity, which is neither picturesque
nor quaint, but only tame- its long and lazy street, lounging
wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula, with Gallows
Hill and New Guinea at one end, and a view of the alms-house at the
other- such being the features of my native town, it would be quite as
reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged
checker-board. And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere, there is
within me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a better
phrase, I must be content to call affection. The sentiment is probably
assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck
into the soil. It is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since
the original Briton, the earliest emigrant of my name, made his
appearance in the wild and forest-bordered settlement, which has since
become a city. And here his descendants have been born and died, and
have mingled their earthy substance with the soil; until no small
portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame
wherewith, for a little while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore,
the attachment which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of
dust for dust. Few of my countrymen can know what it is; nor, as
frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock, need they
consider it desirable to know.

  But the sentiment has likewise its moral quality. The figure of that
first ancestor, invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky
grandeur, was present to my boyish imagination, as far back as I can
remember. It still haunts me, and induces a sort of home-feeling
with the past, which I scarcely claim in reference to the present
phase of the town. I seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here
on account of this grave, bearded, sable-cloaked and steeple-crowned
progenitor- who came so early, with his Bible and his sword, and
trod the unworn street with such a stately port, and made so large a
figure, as a man of war and peace- a stronger claim than for myself,
whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known. He was a soldier,
legislator, judge; he was a ruler in the Church; he had all the
Puritanic traits, both good and evil. He was likewise a bitter
persecutor; as witness the Quakers, who have remembered him in their
histories, and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman
of their sect, which will last longer, it is to be feared, than any
record of his better deeds, although these were many. His son, too,
inherited the persecuting spirit, and made himself so conspicuous in
the martyrdom of the witches, that their blood may fairly be said to
have left a stain upon him. So deep a stain, indeed, that his old
dry bones, in the Charter Street burial-ground, must still retain
it, if they have not crumbled utterly to dust! I know not whether
these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent, and ask pardon
of Heaven, for their cruelties; or whether they are now groaning under
the heavy consequences of them, in another state of being. At all
events, I, the present writer, as their representative, hereby take
shame upon myself for their sakes, and pray that any curse incurred by
them- as I have heard, and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of
the race, for many a long year back, would argue to exist- may be
now and henceforth removed.

  Doubtless, however, either of these stern and black-browed
Puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for
his sins, that, after so long a lapse of years, the old trunk of the
family tree, with so much venerable moss upon it, should have borne,
as its topmost bough, an idler like myself. No aim, that I have ever
cherished, would they recognise as laudable; no success of mine- if
my life, beyond its domestic scope, had ever been brightened by
success- would they deem otherwise than worthless, if not positively
disgraceful. "Where is he?" murmurs one grey shadow of my
forefathers to the other. "A writer of story-books! What kind of a
business in life- what mode of glorifying God, or being serviceable to
mankind in his day and generation- may that be? Why, the degenerate
fellow might as well have been a fiddler!" Such are the compliments
bandied between my great-grandsires and myself, across the gulf of
time! And yet, let them scorn me as they will, strong traits of
their nature have intertwined themselves with mine.

  Planted deep, in the town's earliest infancy and childhood, by these
two earnest and energetic men, the race has ever since subsisted here;
always, too, in respectability; never, so far as I have known,
disgraced by a single unworthy member; but seldom or never, on the
other hand, after the first two generations, performing any
memorable deed, or so much as putting forward a claim to public
notice. Gradually, they have sunk almost out of sight; as old
houses, here and there about the streets, get covered half-way to
the eaves by the accumulation of new soil. From father to son, for
above a hundred years, they followed the sea; a grey-headed
shipmaster, in each generation, retiring from the quarter-deck to
the homestead, while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place
before the mast, confronting the salt spray and the gale, which had
blustered against his sire and grandsire. The boy, also, in due
time, passed from the forecastle to the cabin, spent a tempestuous
manhood, and returned from his world-wanderings, to grow old, and die,
and mingle his dust with the natal earth. This long connection of a
family with one spot, as its place of birth and burial, creates a
kindred between the human being and the locality, quite independent of
any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him.
It is not love, but instinct. The new inhabitant- who came himself
from a foreign land, or whose father or grandfather came- has little
claim to be called a Salemite; he has no conception of the oyster-like
tenacity with which an old settler, over whom his third century is
creeping, clings to the spot where his successive generations have
been imbedded. It is no matter that the place is joyless for him; that
he is weary of the old wooden houses, the mud and dust, the dead level
of site and sentiment, the chill east wind, and the chillest of social
atmospheres; all these, and whatever faults besides he may see or
imagine, are nothing to the purpose. The spell survives, and just as
powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise. So has it
been in my case. I felt it almost as a destiny to make Salem my
home; so that the mould of features and cast of character which had
all along been familiar here- ever, as one representative of the
race lay down in his grave, another assuming, as it were, his
sentry-march along the main street- might still in my little day be
seen and recognised in the old town. Nevertheless, this very sentiment
is an evidence that the connection, which has become an unhealthy one,
should at least be severed. Human nature will not flourish, any more
than a potato, if it be planted and replanted, for too long a series
of generations, in the same worn-out soil. My children have had
other birthplaces, and, so far as their fortunes may be within my
control, shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth.

  On emerging from the Old Manse, it was chiefly this strange,
indolent, unjoyous attachment for my native town, that brought me to
fill a place in Uncle Sam's brick edifice, when I might as well, or
better, have gone somewhere else. My doom was on me. It was not the
first time, nor the second, that I had gone away- as it seemed,
permanently- but yet returned, like the bad halfpenny; or as if
Salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe. So, one
fine morning, I ascended the flight of granite steps, with the
President's commission in my pocket, and was introduced to the corps
of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility, as chief
executive officer of the Custom-House.

  I doubt greatly- or, rather, I do not doubt at all- whether any
public functionary of the United States, either in the civil or
military line, has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans
under his orders as myself. The whereabouts of the Oldest Inhabitant
was at once settled, when I looked at them. For upwards of twenty
years before this epoch, the independent position of the Collector had
kept the Salem Custom-House out of the whirlpool of political
vicissitude, which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile.
A soldier- New England's most distinguished soldier- he stood firmly
on the pedestal of his gallant services; and, himself secure in the
wise liberality of the successive administrations through which he had
held office, he had been the safety of his subordinates in many an
hour of danger and heartquake. General Miller was radically
conservative; a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight
influence; attaching himself strongly to familiar faces, and with
difficulty moved to change, even when change might have brought
unquestionable improvement. Thus, on taking charge of my department, I
found few but aged men. They were ancient sea-captains, for the most
part, who, after being tossed on every sea, and standing up sturdily
against life's tempestuous blast, had finally drifted into this
quiet nook; where, with little to disturb them, except the
periodical terrors of a Presidential election, they one and all
acquired a new lease of existence. Though by no means less liable than
their fellow-men to age and infirmity, they had evidently some
talisman or other that kept death at bay. Two or three of their
number, as I was assured, being gouty and rheumatic, or perhaps
bed-ridden, never dreamed of making their appearance at the
Custom-House during a large part of the year; but, after a torpid
winter, would creep out into the warm sunshine of May or June, go
lazily about what they termed duty, and, at their own leisure and
convenience, betake themselves to bed again. I must plead guilty to
the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of
these venerable servants of the republic. They were allowed, on my
representation, to rest from their arduous labours, and soon
afterwards- as if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their
country's service; as I verily believe it was- withdrew to a better
world. It is a pious consolation to me, that, through my interference,
a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and
corrupt practices, into which, as a matter of course, every
Custom-House officer must be supposed to fall. Neither the front nor
the back entrance of the Custom-House opens on the road to Paradise.

  The greater part of my officers were Whigs. It was well for their
venerable brotherhood that the new Surveyor was not a politician, and,
though a faithful Democrat in principle, neither received nor held his
office with any reference to political services. Had it been
otherwise- had an active politician been put into this influential
post, to assume the easy task of making head against a Whig Collector,
whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his
office- hardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of
official life within a month after the exterminating angel had come up
the Custom-House steps. According to the received code in such
matters, it would have been nothing short of duty, in a politician, to
bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the
guillotine. It was plain enough to discern, that the old fellows
dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands. It pained, and at the
same time amused me, to behold the terrors that attended my advent; to
see a furrowed cheek, weather-beaten by half a century of storm,
turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself;
to detect, as one or another addressed me, the tremor of a voice,
which, in long-past days, had been wont to bellow through a
speaking-trumpet, hoarsely enough to frighten Boreas himself to
silence. They knew, these excellent old persons, that, by all
established rule- and, as regarded some of them, weighed by their own
lack of efficiency for business- they ought to have given place to
younger men, more orthodox in politics, and altogether fitter than
themselves to serve our common Uncle. I knew it too, but could never
quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge. Much and
deservedly to my own discredit, therefore, and considerably to the
detriment of my official conscience, they continued, during my
incumbency, to creep about the wharves, and loiter up and down the
Custom-House steps. They spent a good deal of time, also, asleep in
their accustomed corners, with their chairs tilted back against the
wall; awaking, however, once or twice in a forenoon, to bore one
another with the several thousandth repetition of old sea-stories, and
mouldy jokes, that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among
them.

  The discovery was soon made, I imagine, that the new Surveyor had no
great harm in him. So, with lightsome hearts, and the happy
consciousness of being usefully employed- in their own behalf, at
least, if not for our beloved country- these good old gentlemen went
through the various formalities of office. Sagaciously under their
spectacles, did they peep into the holds of vessels! Mighty was
their fuss about little matters, and marvellous, sometimes, the
obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers!
Whenever such a mischance occurred- when a waggon-load of valuable
merchandise had been smuggled ashore, at noonday, perhaps, and
directly beneath their unsuspicious noses- nothing could exceed the
vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock, and
double-lock, and secure with tape and sealing-wax, all the avenues
of the delinquent vessel. Instead of a reprimand for their previous
negligence, the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their
praiseworthy caution, after the mischief had happened; a grateful
recognition of the promptitude of their zeal, the moment that there
was no longer any remedy.

  Unless people are more than commonly disagreeable, it is my
foolish habit to contract a kindness for them. The better part of my
companion's character, if it have a better part, is that which usually
comes uppermost in my regard, and forms the type whereby I recognise
the man. As most of these old Custom-House officers had good traits,
and as my position in reference to them, being paternal and
protective, was favourable to the growth of friendly sentiments, I
soon grew to like them all. It was pleasant, in the summer
forenoons- when the fervent heat, that almost liquefied the rest of
the human family, merely communicated a genial warmth to their
half-torpid systems- it was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back
entry, a row of them all tipped against the wall, as usual; while
the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out, and came
bubbling with laughter from their lips. Externally, the jollity of
aged men has much in common with the mirth of children; the intellect,
any more than a deep sense of humour, has little to do with the
matter; it is, with both, a gleam that plays upon the surface, and
imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch, and grey,
mouldering trunk. In one case, however, it is real sunshine; in the
other, it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood.

  It would be sad injustice, the reader must understand, to
represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage. In the
first place, my coadjutors were not invariably old; there were men
among them in their strength and prime, of marked ability and
energy, and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode
of life on which their evil stars had cast them. Then, moreover, the
white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an
intellectual tenement in good repair. But, as respects the majority of
my corps of veterans, there will be no wrong done, if I characterise
them generally as a set of wearisome old souls, who had gathered
nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life.
They seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical
wisdom, which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting,
and most carefully to have stored their memories with the husks.
They spoke with far more interest and unction of their morning's
breakfast, or yesterday's, to-day's, or to-morrow's dinner, than of
the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago, and all the world's wonders
which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes.

  The father of the Custom-House- the patriarch, not only of this
little squad of officials, but, I am bold to say, of the respectable
body of tide-waiters all over the United States- was a certain
permanent Inspector. He might truly be termed a legitimate son of
the revenue system, dyed in the wool, or, rather, born in the
purple; since his sire, a Revolutionary colonel, and formerly
collector of the port, had created an office for him, and appointed
him to fill it, at a period of the early ages which few living men can
now remember. This Inspector, when I first knew him, was a man of
fourscore years, or thereabouts, and certainly one of the most
wonderful specimens of winter-green that you would be likely to
discover in a lifetime's search. With his florid cheek, his compact
figure, smartly arrayed in a bright-buttoned blue coat, his brisk
and vigorous step, and his hale and hearty aspect, altogether he
seemed- not young, indeed- but a kind of new contrivance of Mother
Nature in the shape of man, whom age and infirmity had no business
to touch. His voice and laugh, which perpetually reechoed through
the Custom-House, had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an
old man's utterance; they came strutting out of his lungs, like the
crow of a cock, of the blast of a clarion. Looking at him merely as an
animal- and there was very little else to look at- he was a most
satisfactory object, from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness
of his system, and his capacity, at that extreme age, to enjoy all, or
nearly all, the delights which he had ever aimed at, or conceived
of. The careless security of his life in the Custom-House, on a
regular income, and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of
removal, had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over
him. The original and more potent causes, however, lay in the rare
perfection of his animal nature, the moderate proportion of intellect,
and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients;
these latter qualities, indeed, being in barely enough measure to keep
the old gentleman from walking on all-fours. He possessed no power
of thought, no depth of feeling, no troublesome sensibilities;
nothing, in short, but a few commonplace instincts, which, aided by
the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of his physical
well-being, did duty very respectably, and to general acceptance, in
lieu of a heart. He had been the husband of three wives, all long
since dead; the father of twenty children, most of whom, at every
age of childhood or maturity, had likewise returned to dust. Here, one
would suppose, might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest
disposition, through and through, with a sable tinge. Not so with
our old Inspector! One brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire
burden of these dismal reminiscences. The next moment, he was as ready
for sport as any unbreeched infant; far readier than the Collector's
junior clerk, who, at nineteen years, was much the elder and graver
man of the two.

  I used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, I
think, livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there
presented to my notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon; so
perfect in one point of view; so shallow, so delusive, so
impalpable, such an absolute nonentity, in every other. My
conclusion was that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as I
have already said, but instincts: and yet, withal, so cunningly had
the few materials of his character been put together, that there was
no painful perception of deficiency, but, on my part, an entire
contentment with what I found in him. It might be difficult- and it
was so- to conceive how he should exist hereafter, so earthly and
sensuous did he seem; but surely his existence here, admitting that it
was to terminate with his last breath, had been not unkindly given;
with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field,
but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs, and with all their
blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age.

  One point, in which he had vastly the advantage over his four-footed
brethren, was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had
made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat. His
gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait; and to hear him talk of
roast-meat was as appetising as a pickle or an oyster. As he possessed
no higher attribute, and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual
endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the
delight and profit of his maw, it always pleased and satisfied me to
hear him expatiate on fish, poultry, and butcher's meat, and the
most eligible methods of preparing them for the table. His
reminiscences of good cheer, however ancient the date of the actual
banquet, seemed to bring the savour of pig or turkey under one's
very nostrils. There were flavours on his palate, that had lingered
there not less than sixty or seventy years, and were still
apparently as fresh as that of the mutton-chop which he had just
devoured for his breakfast. I have heard him smack his lips over
dinners, every guest at which, except himself, had long been food
for worms. It was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals
were continually rising up before him; not in anger or retribution,
but as if grateful for his former appreciation, and seeking to
repudiate an endless series of enjoyment, at once shadowy and sensual.
A tenderloin of beef, a hind-quarter of veal, a spare-rib of pork, a
particular chicken, or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey, which had
perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder Adams, would be
remembered; while all the subsequent experience of our race, and all
the events that brightened or darkened his individual career, had gone
over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze. The
chief tragic event of the old man's life, so far as I could judge, was
his mishap with a certain goose, which lived and died some twenty or
forty years ago; a goose of most promising figure, but which, at
table, proved so inveterately tough that the carving-knife would
make no impression on its carcass, and it could only be divided with
an axe and handsaw.

  But it is time to quit this sketch; on which, however, I should be
glad to dwell at considerably more length, because, of all men whom
I have ever known, this individual was fittest to be a Custom-House
officer. Most persons, owing to causes which I may not have space to
hint at, suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life. The
old Inspector was incapable of it; and, were he to continue in
office to the end of time, would be just as good as he was then, and
sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite.

  There is one likeness, without which my gallery of Custom-House
portraits would be strangely incomplete; but which my comparatively
few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the
merest outline. It is that of the Collector, our gallant old
General, who, after his brilliant military service, subsequently to
which he had ruled over a wild Western territory, had come hither,
twenty years before, to spend the decline of his varied and honourable
life. The brave soldier had already numbered, nearly or quite, his
threescore years and ten, and was pursuing the remainder of his
earthly march, burdened with infirmities which even the martial
music of his own spirit-stirring recollections could do little towards
lightening. The step was palsied now, that had been foremost in the
charge. It was only with the assistance of a servant, and by leaning
his hand heavily on the iron balustrade, that he could slowly and
painfully ascend the Custom-House steps, and, with a toilsome progress
across the floor, attain his customary chair beside the fireplace.
There he used to sit, gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at
the figures that came and went; amid the rustle of papers, the
administering of oaths, the discussion of business, and the casual
talk of the office; all which sounds and circumstances seemed but
indistinctly to impress his senses, and hardly to make their way
into his inner sphere of contemplation. His countenance, in this
repose, was mild and kindly. If his notice was sought, an expression
of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features; proving that
there was light within him, and that it was only the outward medium of
the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage. The
closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind, the sounder it
appeared. When no longer called upon to speak, or listen, either of
which operations cost him an evident effort, his face would briefly
subside into its former not uncheerful quietude. It was not painful to
behold this look; for though dim, it had not the imbecility of
decaying age. The framework of his nature, originally strong and
massive, was not yet crumbled into ruin.

  To observe and define his character, however, under such
disadvantages, was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up
anew, in imagination, an old fortress, like Ticonderoga, from a view
of its grey and broken ruins. Here and there, perchance, the walls may
remain almost complete; but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound,
cumbrous with its very strength, and overgrown, through long years
of peace and neglect, with grass and alien weeds.

  Nevertheless, looking at the old warrior with affection- for, slight
as was the communication between us, my feeling towards him, like that
of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him, might not improperly be
termed so- I could discern the main points of his portrait. It was
marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not
by a mere accident, but of good right, that he had won a distinguished
name. His spirit could never, I conceive, have been characterised by
an uneasy activity; it must, at any period of his life, have
required an impulse to set him in motion; but, once stirred up, with
obstacles to overcome, and an adequate object to be attained, it was
not in the man to give out or fail. The beat that had formerly
pervaded his nature, and which was not yet extinct, was never of the
kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze; but, rather, a deep, red
glow, as of iron in a furnace. Weight, solidity, firmness; this was
the expression of his repose, even in such decay as had crept untimely
over him, at the period of which I speak. But I could imagine, even
then, that, under some excitement which should go deeply into his
consciousness- roused by a trumpet-peal, loud enough to awaken all
of his energies that were not dead, but only slumbering- he was yet
capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick man's gown,
dropping the staff of age to seize a battle-sword, and starting up
once more a warrior. And, in so intense a moment, his demeanour
would have still been calm. Such an exhibition, however, was but to be
pictured in fancy; not to be anticipated, nor desired. What I saw in
him- as evidently as the indestructible ramparts of, Old
Ticonderoga, already cited as the most appropriate simile- were the
features of stubborn and ponderous endurance, which might well have
amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days; of integrity, that, like
most of his other endowments, lay in a somewhat heavy mass, and was
just as unmalleable and unmanageable as a ton of iron ore; and of
benevolence, which, fiercely as he led the bayonets on at Chippewa
or Fort Erie, I take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what
actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age. He had
slain men with his own hand, for aught I know- certainly, they had
fallen, like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe, before the
charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energy- but, be
that as it might, there was never in his heart so much cruelty as
would have brushed the down off a butterfly's wing. I have not known
the man, to whose innate kindliness I would more confidently make an
appeal.

  Many characteristics- and those, too, which contribute not the least
forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketch- must have vanished, or
been obscured, before I met the General. All merely graceful
attributes are usually the most evanescent; nor does Nature adorn
the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty, that have their roots
and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay, as
she sows wall-flowers over the ruined fortress of Ticonderoga.
Still, even in respect of grace and beauty, there were points well
worth noting. A ray of humour, now and then, would make its way
through the veil of dim obstruction, and glimmer pleasantly upon our
faces. A trait of native elegance, seldom seen in the masculine
character after childhood or early youth, was shown in the General's
fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers. An old soldier
might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow; but
here was one, who seemed to have a young girl's appreciation of the
floral tribe.

  There, beside the fireplace, the brave old General used to sit;
while the Surveyor- though seldom, when it could be avoided, taking
upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversation- was
fond of standing at a distance, and watching his quiet and almost
slumberous countenance. He seemed away from us, although we saw him
but a few yards off; remote, though we passed close beside his
chair; unattainable, though we might have stretched forth our hands
and touched his own. It might be that he lived a more real life within
his thoughts, than amid the unappropriate environment of the
Collector's office. The evolutions of the parade; the tumult of the
battle; the flourish of old, heroic music, heard thirty years before;-
such scenes and sounds, perhaps, were all alive before his
intellectual sense. Meanwhile, the merchants and shipmasters, the
spruce clerks and uncouth sailors, entered and departed; the bustle of
this commercial and Custom-House life kept up its little murmur
round about him; and neither with the men nor their affairs did the
General appear to sustain the most distant relation. He was as much
out of place as an old sword- now rusty, but which had flashed once in
the battle's front, and showed still a bright gleam along its blade-
would have been, among the inkstands, paper-folders, and mahogany
rulers, on the Deputy Collector's desk.

  There was one thing that much aided me in renewing and recreating
the stalwart soldier of the Niagara frontier- the man of true and
simple energy. It was the recollection of those memorable words of
his- "I'll try, sir!"- spoken on the very verge of a desperate and
heroic enterprise, and breathing the soul and spirit of New England
hardihood, comprehending all perils, and encountering all. If, in
our country, valour were rewarded by heraldic honour, this phrase-
which it seems so easy to speak, but which only he, with such a task
of danger and glory before him, has ever spoken- would be the best and
fittest of all mottoes for the General's shield of arms.

  It contributes greatly towards a man's moral and intellectual
health, to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals
unlike himself, who care little for his pursuits, and whose sphere and
abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate. The accidents of my
life have often afforded me this advantage, but never with more
fulness and variety than during my continuance in office. There was
one man, especially, the observation of whose character gave me a
new idea of talent. His gifts were emphatically those of a man of
business; prompt, acute, clear-minded; with an eye that saw through
all perplexities, and a faculty of arrangement that made them
vanish, as by the waving of an enchanter's wand. Bred up from
boyhood in the Custom-House, it was his proper field of activity;
and the many intricacies of business, so harassing to the
interloper, presented themselves before him with the regularity of a
perfectly comprehended system. In my contemplation, be stood as the
ideal of his class. He was, indeed, the Custom-House in himself; or,
at all events, the mainspring that kept its variously revolving wheels
in motion; for, in an institution like this, where its officers are
appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience, and seldom
with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be
performed, they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is
not in them. Thus, by an inevitable necessity, as a magnet attracts
steel-filings, so did our man of business draw to himself the
difficulties which everybody met with. With an easy condescension, and
kind forbearance towards our stupidity- which, to his order of mind,
must have seemed little short of crime- would he forthwith, by the
merest touch of his finger, make the incomprehensible as clear as
daylight. The merchants valued him not less than we, his esoteric
friends. His integrity was perfect; it was a law of nature with him,
rather than a choice or a principle; nor can it be otherwise than
the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as
his, to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs. A
stain on his conscience, as to anything that came within the range
of his vocation, would trouble such a man very much in the same way,
though to a far greater degree, than an error in the balance of an
account, or an ink-blot on the fair page of a book of record. Here, in
a word- and it is a rare instance in my life- I had met with a
person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held.

  Such were some of the people with whom I now found myself connected.
I took it in good part, at the hands of Providence, that I was
thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits; and set
myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had.
After my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the
dreamy brethren of Brook Farm; after living for three years within the
subtile influence of an intellect like Emerson's; after those wild,
free days on the Assabeth, indulging fantastic speculations, beside
our fire of fallen boughs, with Ellery Channing; after talking with
Thoreau about pine-trees and Indian relics, in his hermitage at
Walden; after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic
refinement of Hillard's culture; after becoming imbued with poetic
sentiment at Longfellow's hearth-stone- it was time, at length, that I
should exercise other faculties of my nature, and nourish myself
with food for which I had hitherto had little appetite. Even the old
Inspector was desirable, as a change of diet, to a man who had known
Alcott. I looked upon it as an evidence, in some measure, or a
system naturally well balanced, and lacking no essential part of a
thorough organisation, that, with such associates to remember, I could
mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities, and never
murmur at the change.

  Literature, its exertions and objects, were now of little moment
in my regard. I cared not, at this period, for books; they were
apart from me. Nature- except it were human nature- the nature that is
developed in earth and sky, was, in one sense, hidden from me; and all
the imaginative delight, wherewith it had been spiritualised, passed
away out of my mind. A gift, a faculty, if it had not departed, was
suspended and inanimate within me. There would have been something
sad, unutterably dreary, in all this, had I not been conscious that it
lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past. It
might be true, indeed, that this was a life which could not, with
impunity, be lived too long; else, it might make me permanently
other than I had been, without transforming me into any shape which it
would be worth my while to take. But I never considered it as other
than a transitory life. There was always a prophetic instinct, a low
whisper in my ear, that, within no long period, and whenever a new
change of custom should be essential to my good, a change would come.

  Meanwhile, there I was, a Surveyor of the Revenue, and, so far as
I have been able to understand, as good a Surveyor as need be. A man
of thought, fancy, and sensibility (had he ten times the Surveyor's
proportion of those qualities) may, at any time, be a man of
affairs, if he will only choose to give himself the trouble. My
fellow-officers, and the merchants and sea-captains with whom my
official duties brought me into any manner of connection, viewed me in
no other light, and probably knew me in no other character. None of
them, I presume, had ever read a page of my inditing, or would have
cared a fig the more for me, if they had read them all; nor would it
have mended the matter, in the least, had those same unprofitable
pages been written with a pen like that of Burns or of Chaucer, each
of whom was a Custom-House officer in his day, as well as I. It is a
good lesson- though it may often be a hard one- for a man who has
dreamed of literary fame, and of making for himself a rank among the
world's dignitaries by such means, to step aside out of the narrow
circle in which his claims are recognised, and to find how utterly
devoid of significance, beyond that circle, is all that he achieves,
